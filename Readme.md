This is a game about eating mapo tofu and managing spice that may or may not be loosely based on a minigame from a certain fighting game.
The main purpose of creating this project is to familarise myself with mobile game development with Unity, so please do not expect a well-organised or
well-written code base.

## Target platforms

I will begin with making this work for Android, and hopefully later expanding to iOS if time permits.
